Class::Holon -  An experiment in redefining class declarations / object instantiation in perl.


file: Atom.pm
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	package Atom;
	use Class::Holon 
	( 
		To => DescribeLevel, 
		Type => Hash,
		Data => { protons=>0, neutrons=>0, electrons=>0 },
	);
	


file: atom.pl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	use Atom;
	my $atom = Class::Holon::New('Atom');



The basic features are in place. You can describe levels,
describe levels that include sublevels, create instances, etc.

The next step is to add the features that actually make it
worthwhile to use this approach versus the standard perl approach.
